      <b>Hong Kong Cruciform Housing: Shape Analysis</b><br><br>
      The cruciform-type housing design is straightforward, relying on the repetition of identical floor plans. Each unit is mirrored or rotated to create symmetry, 
      with no variation. For instance, the Concord 1 type features eight identical units per floor, arranged symmetrically and extruded into towers of over 40 stories. 
      These units are designed to accommodate 3-4 person nuclear families.
      This approach prioritizes efficiency and speed of construction but overlooks the diverse lifestyles and needs of residents. The uniformity of the design reflects a 
      one-size-fits-all mindset, failing to adapt to the varying demands of Hong Kong's dynamic population.

          <b>Egress Travel Distance Analysis</b><br><br>
          Code of Practice for The Provision of Means of Escape in Case of Fire by Building Authority of Hong Kong states that for buildings with 2 staircases where the exit route
          is not along balcony approach should be 30m Maximum. The analysis shows that the maximum egress travel distance for Concord 1 type is far below 30m, thanks to its efficient
          radial layout, leaving much more room for extension of floor area.

      <b>Residential Unit Perimeter Research and Variation</b><br><br>
      Research shows that as the climate warms, building perimeters tend to increase relative to their area, as measured by the isoperimetric quotient. <br><br>
      Iterative tests on the Concord 1 residential units adjusted their external perimeters, revealing key trade-offs. Larger perimeters improve natural ventilation but also increase heat loss and spatial inefficiency. These changes impact privacy, circulation, and insulation, requiring a careful balance between thermal performance, ventilation, and space utilization.

      <b>Plan Arrangement</b><br><br>
      The next generation of crucifix towers is designed by attaching finalized unit clusters to a central core. These clusters form a cohesive community within a single residential tower, 
      creating a new identity through the integration of units, communal spaces, structural systems, and circulation pathways. While introducing innovation, the design retains the traditional 
      principle of cruciform towers: units are connected to the central core via the shortest horizontal circulation routes.

        <p><b>Visibility Analysis</b><br><br>
        One of the important reason for a crucifix type plan is that it ensures a good view from all of the units evenly. However, the problem with Concord 1 type housing is 
        that it is possible to see from one unit to another, hindering the privacy. The new plan suggests to rotate the rooms 45degree alternatively, so that the view from 
        adjacent rooms are parallel to each other, ensuring a much better privacy.
        The visibility is calculated by the percent of the angle of the outside view out of 360°. For example, a 30% view rate means 108° out of 360° is open toward outside.
        Overall, the updated plan provides a higher general visibility rate, while its visibility is less even than the original Concord 1 plan. Which means the updated plan 
        is consisted of either rooms with very high or very low visibility rate.</p></div>

      <b>Unit Types and Combination</b><br><br>
      The final unit design is consisted of 2 types of spaces: Standard type and non-standard types. The purpose of the standard type is to provide appropriate number of necessary spaces: bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen. The non standard type spaces are seving for more specific activities for people with different lifestyle. Standard and Non-standard types are mixed up in a matrix so that appropriate combinations can be created.
